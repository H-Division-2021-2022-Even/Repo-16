<strong>Team-16 </strong>a.k.a  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cascade 3301 (4Chan)</span></strong>  We as aspiring stewards of KLE Tech concentrate on improving clients (kids) educational skills such as,
<ul>
 	<li>Focus &amp; Self control</li>
 	<li>Critical Thinking</li>
 	<li>Decision Making</li>
</ul>
This crew is <strong>involved in making children</strong> learn to play some <strong>fascinating educational games.</strong> With a sense of excitement and hope, we ensure that children would feel like they are <strong>being improvised</strong> and are<strong> being experts</strong> in their appropriate fields.
